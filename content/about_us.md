# About ScaleConf

ScaleConf is a two-day conference that brings together local and international experts to share their ideas on the problems faced by companies and individuals building and running services on the internet today.

The presentations will cover the culture and methodologies used to architect and develop strong foundations required to operate websites and services.

## A brief history
Having attended various conferences in the Bay Area (notably CodeConf and DevOpsDays), Jonathan and Duncan found themselves wishing that there were more tech conferences of that calibre accessible locally. At dinner one evening in October 2011, they decided that they would have to hold one themselves, and since their areas of expertise revolved around DevOps and high availability, the idea of ScaleConf was born.

With Duncan leaving to work for Facebook in February 2012, they only had two and a half months to make the idea a reality. Thanks to the expert help of Marije and Jen from Lessfuss, a bit of luck, and several willing speakers and sponsors,

The first conference was organised in two and a half months and was held on January 26 and 27, 2012. A large number of people asked when it would happen again, and because other amazing tech conferences are becoming regular events in South Africa, the second ScaleConf was held on April 18 and 19, 2013. Now it's a regular thing and we are bringing ScaleConf back in April 2014. Don't forget to check out [JSinSA](http://www.jsinsa.com/), [rubyfuza](http://rubyfuza.org/) and [PyConZA](http://za.pycon.org/) for more international-level events happening locally!
